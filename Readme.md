A comprehensive README.md is crucial for your GitHub repository, holding 10% of the evaluation points under Prototype Functionality (implicitly, as part of the codebase deliverables) and ensuring collaborators/judges can quickly set up your project.

Here is a ready-to-use README.md structure based on your project:

Clarity AI: The Context-Aware Messaging Assistant ‚úçÔ∏è
üéØ Project Overview
Clarity AI is a real-time, context-aware writing assistant implemented as a Chrome Extension, designed to integrate seamlessly into web-based messaging platforms like WhatsApp Web. It addresses the common challenge of users struggling to compose clear, appropriately toned, and contextually relevant messages.


The tool provides ghost-text suggestions and on-demand tone conversion directly within the chat interface, focusing on user personalization, control, and secure integration.

This project was developed for the Inter IIT Tech Meet 14.0 Software Development Problem Statement.

‚ú® Key Features & Functionality
Smart Auto-Completion (Ghost Text):

Provides inline, ghost-text suggestions while the user types.



Suggestions are generated with low latency and can be copied quickly using a custom keyboard shortcut (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Y).




Tone Adaptation (Two-Tiered):


Real-Time: Modifies ghost-text suggestions based on a tone selected by the user, supporting Formal, Casual, and Friendly tones.




Post-Drafting Refinement: Provides an on-demand re-write feature in the popup UI (e.g., "Make it Formal") for longer, completed drafts.


Performance Optimization:


Debounce: API requests are only triggered after the user pauses typing for 500ms.



Throttling: Limits consecutive API calls to once every 2¬†seconds to minimize API usage and prevent spamming.


üõ°Ô∏è Security & Privacy (Mandatory Requirement)
Clarity AI is built on a Frontend-Only Integration model to ensure maximum user privacy.


User API Key: Users are required to input their own OpenAI API key.



Secure Storage: The API key is encrypted and securely stored in Chrome's local storage (chrome.storage.local).






Zero Data Transmission: The key never leaves the user's browser and is not transmitted to any external servers or our team's backend. All API calls are made directly from the extension.




‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
A stable, modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge).

An OpenAI API Key (required for LLM functionality).

Installation (Developer Mode)
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [Your-Repo-URL-Here]
cd Clarity-AI
Load the Extension in Chrome:

Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.

Enable Developer mode using the toggle switch in the top right corner.

Click the "Load unpacked" button.

Select the Clarity-AI project directory you just cloned.

Configure API Key (Mandatory):

Click on the Clarity AI extension icon in your toolbar.

Navigate to the settings area (if implemented in popup) or follow the on-screen prompt to enter your OpenAI API Key.

The key will be securely saved locally.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Frontend/Extension: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS, Chrome Extension API.

LLM Integration: OpenAI API (gpt-3.5-turbo or equivalent) via direct secure calls.

Optimization: Debouncing, Throttling, chrome.storage.local for persistent state management.

üìà Future Scope & Scalability
The Modular Extension Architecture makes the core logic reusable and easy to extend. Future plans include:




Cross-Platform Expansion: Extending the solution to platforms like Gmail, Slack, and Discord.




Advanced Context: Analyzing previous chat messages for richer context-aware suggestions.
